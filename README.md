Bowler Studio Small Kat game controller

## What does it do?
This is a controller is meant to control [SmallKat](https://hackaday.io/messages/room/279391).
It was designed to accomodate [classic controller mapping](https://github.com/javatechs/WiiChuck#classic-controller-mapping), 
very loosely based on [the Wii controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Classic_Controller). The controller communicates with [Bowler Studio](http://commonwealthrobotics.com/), a robotic development and device management platform. Bowler Studio interprets the controls and directs SmallKat movement.
